# Feature testing sample with ShouldIT

This is a sample project to demonstrate basic feature testing using [ShouldIT](http://bbc-sport.github.io/ShouldIT/).

I wrote a post that uses this sample called [Feature documentation and testing is easy](http://perrymitchell.net/article/feature-documentation-and-testing-is-easy/).
